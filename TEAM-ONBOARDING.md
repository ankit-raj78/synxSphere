## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Docker Issues
**Issue:** Docker not starting
**Solution:** 
```bash
# Check Docker status
docker --version
docker info

# Restart Docker Desktop
# Windows/Mac: Restart Docker Desktop app
# Linux: sudo systemctl restart docker
```

### Port Conflicts
**Issue:** Ports already in use
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check what's using ports
lsof -i :3000 -i :3003 -i :3005 -i :8080

# Kill conflicting processes
sudo kill -9 [PID]

# Or use different ports by editing .env.dev
```

### Build Failures
**Issue:** Docker build fails
**Solution:**
```bash
# Clean Docker cache
docker system prune -f

# Rebuild from scratch
./deploy-docker.sh dev build
```

### Services Not Starting
**Issue:** Some services fail to start
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check individual service logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs [service-name]

# Restart specific service
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml restart [service-name]
```

### Collaboration Not Working
**Issue:** Real-time sync not working
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check API health
curl http://localhost:3003/api/health

# Check collaboration logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f collaboration

# Verify WebSocket connection in browser developer tools
```

## üìû Getting Help

### Documentation
- [ ] `README-DOCKER.md` - Complete Docker guide
- [ ] `INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md` - Full installation guide
- [ ] `README-SETUP.md` - Quick setup guide

### Support Channels
