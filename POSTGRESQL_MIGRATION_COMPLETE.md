- **Token Verification**: Seamless integration across all APIs
- **Password Security**: bcrypt hashing maintained
- **User Sessions**: Proper user isolation and data privacy

### 2. **Audio Management APIs** - ✅ FULLY MIGRATED
- **File Upload** (`/api/audio/upload`): Multi-file upload with PostgreSQL storage
- **File Listing** (`/api/audio/files`): User-specific file retrieval
- **Audio Streaming** (`/api/audio/stream/[id]`): Direct file streaming with authentication
- **Background Analysis**: Async audio feature analysis and database storage
- **File Management**: Proper file system integration with database records

### 3. **Room Management** - ✅ FULLY MIGRATED  
- **Room Creation**: PostgreSQL-based room persistence
- **Room Access**: UUID-based room identification
- **Participant Management**: Many-to-many relationship tables
- **Room Settings**: JSONB configuration storage

### 4. **Database Architecture** - ✅ COMPLETELY RESTRUCTURED
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL with proper relationships
- **Schema Design**: Comprehensive tables for all functionality
- **Data Types**: UUID primary keys, JSONB for flexible data
- **Indexes**: Optimized for performance
- **Triggers**: Automatic timestamp updates

## 📊 Database Schema

### Core Tables Created:
```sql
✅ users                 - User accounts and profiles
✅ rooms                 - Collaboration rooms  
✅ room_participants     - Room membership with roles
✅ audio_files           - Individual file management
✅ audio_tracks          - Room-associated audio tracks
✅ audio_analysis        - Audio feature analysis results
✅ user_sessions         - Session management
✅ password_reset_tokens - Password recovery
```

### Key Features:
- **UUID Primary Keys**: Better security and distribution
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Data integrity enforcement
- **JSONB Fields**: Flexible metadata and settings storage
- **Automatic Timestamps**: Created/updated tracking
- **Indexes**: Optimized query performance

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### API Routes Updated:
```
✅ /api/auth/register     - PostgreSQL user creation
✅ /api/auth/login        - PostgreSQL authentication  
✅ /api/audio/upload      - PostgreSQL file management
✅ /api/audio/files       - PostgreSQL file listing
✅ /api/audio/stream/[id] - PostgreSQL file serving
✅ /api/rooms             - PostgreSQL room management
✅ /api/rooms/[id]        - PostgreSQL room access
```

### Database Connections:
- **Next.js APIs**: Custom PostgreSQL connection manager
- **Microservices**: Shared database manager with connection pooling
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when database unavailable
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting and logging

### Security Features:
- **JWT Authentication**: Maintained across all services
- **User Isolation**: Proper data access controls
- **Input Validation**: Maintained for all endpoints
- **File Security**: Authenticated file access only
