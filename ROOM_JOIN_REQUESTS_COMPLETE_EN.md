# Room Join Request Feature Completion Report

## üéØ Feature Overview

Successfully implemented a complete room join request-approval mechanism, resolving all user-reported issues.

## ‚úÖ Resolved Issues

### 1. Room Participant Count Display Fix
- **Issue**: Room participant count displayed as 0
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed API query to use `COUNT(DISTINCT rp.user_id)` for correct participant statistics
  - Automatically add creator as participant when room is created
  - Display format: `1/6`, `2/6`, etc.

### 2. Room Creator Delete Function
- **Issue**: Missing room deletion functionality
- **Solution**:
  - Added delete button on room page (visible only to creator)
  - Implemented `DELETE /api/rooms/[id]` API route
  - Clean up all related data when deleting (participants, requests, etc.)

### 3. Join Room Request-Approval Mechanism
- **Issue**: Need to implement room join request functionality
- **Solution**:
  - Created `room_join_requests` database table
  - Implemented complete request flow API
  - Room creators receive real-time request notifications
  - Can approve/reject requests

## üèóÔ∏è New Features

### Database Table Structure
```sql
CREATE TABLE room_join_requests (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    room_id UUID NOT NULL,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL,
    message TEXT DEFAULT '',
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending',
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    processed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    UNIQUE(room_id, user_id, status)
);
```

### API Routes
1. `POST /api/rooms/[id]/join` - Send join request
2. `GET /api/rooms/[id]/join` - Get request list (room creator)
3. `PUT /api/rooms/[id]/join/[requestId]` - Process request (approve/reject)
4. `DELETE /api/rooms/[id]` - Delete room
