# SyncSphere Issue Resolution Summary

## Status: ✅ All Resolved

### 1. ✅ Room Details API - Missing instruments field
**Issue**: `error: column rp.instruments does not exist`

**Cause**: Missing `instruments` column in `room_participants` table schema

**Solution**:
- Updated `database/postgresql-init.sql` to add `instruments JSONB DEFAULT '[]'` column
- Ran database schema update script
- Re-initialized database table structure

**Verification**: ✅ Room creation and access functionality works normally

### 2. ✅ Audio Upload API - file.name read error  
**Issue**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'replace')`

**Cause**:
- Audio upload API directly accessing `file.name` but this property could be undefined
- Missing safety checks when handling file objects
- Syntax formatting issues (missing line breaks)

**Solution**:
- Fixed syntax errors in `app/api/audio/upload/route.ts`
- Added safety check: `const safeName = (file.name || 'unknown-file').replace(...)`
- Added default value handling for all file properties
- Fixed file object extension method in frontend FileUpload component

**Verification**: ✅ Audio upload functionality works completely

### 3. ✅ Add Track functionality
**Issue**: Add track functionality couldn't work normally due to the above two issues

**Solution**: By fixing the audio upload API, add track functionality automatically recovered

**Verification**: ✅ Can upload and manage audio files normally
