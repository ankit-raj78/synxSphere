# openDAW File System

openDAW stores your projects and samples in the
[Origin private file system](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_API/Origin_private_file_system) (
OPFS).

## Why Samples?

openDAW uses the OPFS to store user-imported samples because modern browsers do not retain
information about the file origins of imported local files due to security restrictions. This means that once a user
imports a file, the browser has no way to automatically reload it the next time openDAW starts. To ensure persistent
access to user samples, openDAW copies every imported sample into OPFS, allowing the application to manage and retrieve
these files securely without relying on external file paths.

## Granting OPFS Storage Permission in Firefox
In Firefox, storing data in OPFS requires explicit user approval due to its privacy settings. Without permission, openDAW may not be able to retain imported samples across sessions. To allow persistent storage for openDAW in Firefox, follow these steps:

* Open Firefox Settings
* Navigate to Privacy & Security
* Scroll down to Permissions and find Storage Permissions
* Click Exceptions and enter the openDAW studio URL `https://opendaw.studio`
* Select Allow and confirm the changes
* Restart Firefox for the settings to take effect
