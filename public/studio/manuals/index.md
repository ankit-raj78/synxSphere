## Known Issues

**openDAW is in an early prototype stage and NOT ready for production use!**

### General

* Some features in openDAW may be unpolished or not functional yet.
* No backward compatibility guaranteed. New studio versions may invalidate old project files.

### Audio Engine

* Not optimised.
* Clicks & Pops can occur, since there are no fadings to avoid discontinuities.
* Fast automation or value changes can potentially crash the dsp, since there is no interpolation.
