/*
 * OpenDAW Integration Patch
 * 
 * This is a clean integration template that shows how to integrate
 * the collaboration system with OpenDAW's agents.ts file.
 * 
 * The actual integration is already implemented in:
 * openDAW/studio/src/service/agents.ts
 */

// This file serves as documentation and backup for the integration approach.
// The real implementation is in the openDAW/studio/src/service/agents.ts file.

/*
 * INTEGRATION OVERVIEW:
 * 
 * 1. Enhanced agents.ts with collaboration support
 * 2. Project auto-save and auto-load functionality
 * 3. Integration with OpenDAW's native save/load system
 * 4. StudioService integration for project serialization
 * 
 * KEY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
 * 
 * ✅ Collaborative OPFS Agent with real-time sync
 * ✅ Auto-save every 30 seconds when changes are made
 * ✅ Auto-load projects when users join
 * ✅ Integration with OpenDAW's native serialization
 * ✅ Manual save/load through existing OpenDAW UI
 * ✅ Project persistence in PostgreSQL database
 * ✅ Multi-user collaboration with ownership tracking
 * 
 * USAGE:
 * 
 * 1. Start collaboration server: npm run server (in opendaw-collab-mvp)
 * 2. Start OpenDAW: npm run dev (in openDAW/studio)  
 * 3. Open with collaboration params:
 *    https://localhost:8080/?collaborative=true&projectId=test&userId=user1
 * 
 * PROJECT LIFECYCLE:
 * 
 * 1. New Project Creation:
 *    - User creates new project in OpenDAW
 *    - Project state auto-saved to database after changes
 *    - Other users can join and see the project
 * 
 * 2. Project Loading:
 *    - User opens OpenDAW with projectId parameter
 *    - System checks database for existing project
 *    - If found, loads using OpenDAW's native deserialization
 *    - If not found, starts with empty project
 * 
 * 3. Auto-Save:
 *    - Monitors OPFS write/delete operations
 *    - Triggers save 30 seconds after last change
 *    - Uses OpenDAW's Project.toArrayBuffer() method
 *    - Stores in database with project metadata
 * 
 * 4. Manual Save:
 *    - Users can use OpenDAW's existing save functionality
 *    - Collaboration system detects manual saves
 *    - Syncs changes to database and other users
 * 
 * FILES MODIFIED/CREATED:
 * 
 * - openDAW/studio/src/service/agents.ts (enhanced)
 * - openDAW/studio/src/collaboration/* (new collaboration system)
 * - opendaw-collab-mvp/server/* (collaboration backend)
 * 
 * TESTING:
 * 
 * Run: node test-collaboration-monitor.js
 * 
 * This will provide test URLs and monitor collaboration activity.
