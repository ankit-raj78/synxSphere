## 📁 File Structure

### API Endpoints
```
/api/audio/
├── files/                    # Uploaded audio files
├── upload/                   # File upload endpoint
├── stream/[id]/             # Audio streaming
├── delete/                  # File deletion
├── compose/                 # Audio composition
└── compositions/
    ├── route.ts             # List compositions
    ├── stream/[id]/         # Composition streaming
    └── delete/              # Composition deletion
```

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Uploaded audio files
CREATE TABLE audio_files (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    filename VARCHAR(255),
    original_name VARCHAR(255),
    file_path VARCHAR(500),
    file_size BIGINT,
    mime_type VARCHAR(100),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Composed music tracks
CREATE TABLE compositions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    room_id UUID REFERENCES rooms(id),
    title VARCHAR(255),
    filename VARCHAR(255),
    file_path VARCHAR(500),
    file_size BIGINT,
    mime_type VARCHAR(100),
    source_track_ids UUID[],
    source_track_count INTEGER,
    composition_settings JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Component Architecture
```typescript
// MusicRoomDashboard.tsx - Main component
interface ComponentState {
  uploadedTracks: AudioFile[]
  compositions: Composition[]
  currentPlayingTrack: string | null
  currentPlayingType: 'track' | 'composition' | null
  audioRef: HTMLAudioElement | null
  audioProgress: number
  audioDuration: number
}
```

## 🚀 Technical Implementation

### Audio Playback System
```typescript
const handlePlayTrack = async (track: any) => {
  // Create new audio element with HTML5 Audio API
  const newAudio = new Audio()
  
  // Fetch audio blob from streaming endpoint
  const response = await fetch(`/api/audio/stream/${track.id}`)
  const blob = await response.blob()
  const audioUrl = URL.createObjectURL(blob)
  
  // Set up event listeners for progress tracking
  newAudio.onloadedmetadata = () => setAudioDuration(newAudio.duration)
  newAudio.ontimeupdate = () => {
    if (newAudio.duration) {
      setAudioProgress((newAudio.currentTime / newAudio.duration) * 100)
    }
  }
  
  await newAudio.play()
}
```

### FFmpeg Audio Composition
```typescript
const ffmpegCommand = `"${ffmpegPath}" ${inputs} 
  -filter_complex "${filters}amix=inputs=${tracks.length}:duration=longest" 
  -ac 2 -ar ${sampleRate} -b:a ${bitrate} "${outputPath}"`

execSync(ffmpegCommand)
```

### Progress Bar Implementation
```typescript
const handleProgressClick = (e: React.MouseEvent<HTMLDivElement>) => {
  const rect = e.currentTarget.getBoundingClientRect()
  const clickX = e.clientX - rect.left
  const newTime = (clickX / rect.width) * audioDuration
  audioRef.currentTime = newTime
}
```

  channels: 2,
  mixingAlgorithm: 'amix'
}
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Benefits

### Separation of Concerns
- **Uploaded Files**: Individual audio tracks for remixing
- **Compositions**: Mixed tracks as separate entities
- **Database**: Proper normalization with dedicated tables
- **API**: RESTful endpoints for each functionality

### Performance Optimizations
- **Streaming**: Audio served as blobs for efficient loading
- **Indexing**: Database indexes on user_id, created_at
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of audio URLs
- **Background Processing**: FFmpeg composition doesn't block UI

### Scalability Features
- **Room Association**: Compositions linked to specific rooms
- **User Isolation**: Each user sees only their files
- **File Size Tracking**: Metadata for storage management
- **Settings Storage**: JSONB for flexible composition parameters

## 📝 Usage Examples
