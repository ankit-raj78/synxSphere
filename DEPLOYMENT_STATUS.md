# SyncSphere EC2 Deployment Status

## Migration Complete ✅

Successfully migrated SyncSphere from AWS ECS to EC2 deployment.

### Current Deployment

**EC2 Instance:** `i-0db2ab9dd0910f985`
**Public IP:** `54.198.119.67`
**Instance Type:** t3.medium
**Platform:** x86_64 (amd64)

### Application Status

- **Application URL:** http://54.198.119.67:3000
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 15 running in Docker
- **Application:** Next.js app running in Docker with amd64 architecture
- **Docker Image:** `752233440549.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/syncsphere:amd64`

### Running Containers

1. **syncsphere-app**: Application container
   - Port: 3000
   - Status: Running (health check has minor issues but app is functional)
   - Image: ECR amd64 build

2. **syncsphere-db**: PostgreSQL database
   - Port: 5432
   - Status: Running normally
   - Data: Persistent volume mounted

### Environment Variables

- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://syncsphere_user:syncsphere_password@db:5432/syncsphere_db`
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key`
- `NEXTAUTH_URL=http://54.198.119.67:3000`

### Security Configuration

- Security Group: `sg-004c8b13ab1c8f876`
- Open Ports: 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), 3000 (Application)
- SSH Key: `syncsphere-key.pem`

### ECS Cleanup Status ✅

- ✅ ECS Task Definitions deregistered (syncsphere-task:1, syncsphere-task:2)
- ✅ No active ECS clusters
- ✅ No active ECS services
- ✅ No ECS-related CloudWatch log groups found

### Cost Savings

Moving from ECS Fargate to EC2:
- ECS Fargate: ~$30-50/month for continuous running
- EC2 t3.medium: ~$30/month (24/7) with more control and flexibility
- Additional savings from simplified architecture and direct container management

### Next Steps

1. Consider setting up SSL/TLS certificate for HTTPS
2. Implement proper backup strategy for PostgreSQL data
3. Set up monitoring and alerting
4. Consider using an Application Load Balancer for production
5. Fix health check script if needed for proper container health monitoring

### Access Instructions

To access the application:
1. Open browser to: http://54.198.119.67:3000
2. For SSH access: `ssh -i syncsphere-key.pem ec2-user@54.198.119.67`

The application is now successfully running on EC2 with the correct architecture (amd64) and all services functional.
